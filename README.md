# Profit-Trailer-V2-with-PT-Feeder
These are my current settings when using Profit Trailer V2 with PT Feeder.

These have been created using other peoples settings and help. To give credit I have been really helped by the following:

1) Official forum channel - https://forum.ptfeeder.co/
2) CryptoBoss discord channel - https://discord.gg/rffzEYE 
3) CryptoStonersHouse discord channel - https://discord.gg/9ucG7WZ
4) Article on Medium - https://medium.com/@wisepapertiger/profit-trailer-bitcoin-cryptobot-that-makes-lots-of-money-bitcoin-currency-trading-c4f618e048fc

I suggest you check these groups and article out if you are using PT Feeder (or just Profit Trailer V2), they are so helpful!

You can now add TradingView into PT Feeder, good scripts can be found at:

1) My website https://slumdogtrader.com
2) Discord Channel https://discord.gg/NNgBy28 
3) Telegram group https://t.me/SlumdogTraderGroup 

I am doing this so that people can learn from scratch just like me, and hopefully help each other out. So please do ask away!
