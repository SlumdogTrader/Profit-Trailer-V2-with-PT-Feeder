# Profit-Trailer-V2-with-PT-Feeder
These are my current settings when using Profit Trailer V2 with PT Feeder.

These have been created using other peoples settings and help. To give credit I have been really helped by the following:

1) official forum channel - https://forum.ptfeeder.co/
2) CryptoBoss discord channel - https://discord.gg/rffzEYE 
3) CryptoStonersHouse discord channel - https://discord.gg/9ucG7WZ
4) Article on Medium - https://medium.com/@wisepapertiger/profit-trailer-bitcoin-cryptobot-that-makes-lots-of-money-bitcoin-currency-trading-c4f618e048fc

I suggest you check these groups and article out if you are using PT Feeder (or just Profit Trailer V2), they are so helpful!
